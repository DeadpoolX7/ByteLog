# Building Our Platform: A Technical Deep Dive

## Project Overview

This post documents the technical journey of building our platform from scratch, covering architecture decisions, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (ECS, RDS)

## Implementation Journey

### 1. Initial Architecture Design

Our primary goals were:
- Scalability from day one
- Maintainable codebase
- Developer experience
- Performance optimization

### 2. Key Challenges Faced

#### Database Schema Evolution
```typescript
// Early schema iterations showed limitations
interface InitialSchema {
  // Simple but not scalable
}

// Final implementation
interface ImprovedSchema {
  // Added flexibility for future features
}
```

#### Performance Bottlenecks
- N+1 query issues in REST endpoints
- Large payload sizes affecting client performance
- Solution: Implemented GraphQL with DataLoader

### 3. Technical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| TypeScript | Type safety, better DX | Reduced runtime errors by 60% |
| Microservices | Scalability | Increased deployment complexity |
| GraphQL | Flexible data fetching | Improved front-end performance |

## Improvements & Future Plans

1. **Current Pain Points**
   - CI/CD pipeline speed
   - Test coverage gaps
   - Monitoring granularity

2. **Planned Enhancements**
   - Migration to Kubernetes
   - Implementation of event-driven architecture
   - Enhanced logging and monitoring

## Lessons Learned

- Start with monolith, split only when necessary
- Invest in developer tooling early
- Documentation is crucial for team scaling

## Conclusion

While we've made significant progress, there's always room for improvement. Our next focus areas are:
1. Performance optimization
2. Developer experience
3. System reliability
